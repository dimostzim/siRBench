SUMMARY
1. Explored the siRBench train/validation splits (3,068/340 samples, 105 columns) with no missing
data, confirming non-overlapping siRNA sequences and identifying thermodynamic/accessibility
features most correlated with knockdown efficacy.
2. Removed the duplicate numeric_label leakage column and highlighted guide-end stability vs. target
accessibility as the dominant signal sources.
3. Engineered an expanded 264-feature representation by combining the curated descriptors with 94
sequence-derived statistics, then standardized features via a saved preprocessing pipeline
(FeatureBuilder + StandardScaler).
4. Selected LightGBM as the primary regressor, complemented by CatBoost and ElasticNet models, and
formed a weighted ensemble (0.54/0.33/0.13) to balance tree-based expressiveness with linear
robustness.
5. Tuned LightGBM to use 18k estimators, larger num_leaves (28), and calibrated regularization,
while CatBoost leveraged GPU Poisson bagging and ElasticNet provided a stabilized linear baseline.
6. Achieved train RMSE 0.133 (R² 0.462) and validation RMSE 0.141 (R² 0.387), with Pearson
correlations ~0.69 (train) and ~0.63 (validation), indicating moderate generalization on the hold-
out set.
7. Noted extreme train MAPE caused by near-zero targets, while validation MAPE (0.256) remained
reasonable, validating the modeling choices for siRNA efficacy prediction.

[DATA EXPLORATION]
data_description: Loaded the official siRBench training split (3,068 rows × 105 columns) and validation split (340 ×
105). Each dataset contains three sequence columns (siRNA, mRNA, extended_mRNA), 100 engineered
thermodynamic, folding, and accessibility descriptors, along with the continuous target variable and
a duplicate numeric_label column equal to target. No missing values or constant columns were
detected. Target values range from 0 to 1, with mean ≈0.537, std ≈0.181 for training and similar
statistics on validation. No siRNA sequence overlap exists between the splits, supporting a clean
hold-out evaluation.
feature_analysis: Top positive Pearson correlations with target stem from guide-end stability metrics (ends ≈0.389,
DG_pos1 ≈0.381, DH_pos1 ≈0.350) and global duplex energies (duplex_energy_total ≈0.286, DG_total
≈0.286). Strongest negative correlations involve duplex accessibility penalties at the guide
5′/target 3′ interface (duplex_energy_sirna_pos2 and duplex_energy_target_pos18 ≈−0.373,
duplex_energy_target_pos19 ≈−0.335, duplex_energy_sirna_pos1 ≈−0.335). These features align with
reported biological importance of seed-end thermodynamics and target accessibility, suggesting high
predictive value. No anomalies in feature distributions were observed during this pass.
reasoning: Executed exploratory analysis per instructions: assessed dataset shapes, types, missingness, and
correlation structure to inform downstream modeling. Focused on known leakage feature removal
(numeric_label) and verified train/validation comparability, while confirming key thermodynamic
descriptors that warrant prioritization in modeling.

[DATA REPRESENTATION]
representation: Created representation_run10.joblib containing standardized feature matrices for training
(3,068×264) and validation (340×264). Inputs combine original thermodynamic/folding/accessibility
descriptors (excluding leakage column and raw sequences) with 94 sequence-derived features: GC/AU
fractions, seed/tail contrasts, base composition of siRNA/mRNA/extended_mRNA, canonical pairing
ratios, positional base codes, and contextual summaries. Features were expanded through the existing
FeatureBuilder (group stats, segment trends, interaction gaps) and scaled via a train-fitted
StandardScaler. Stored alongside are the target arrays, feature name list, FeatureBuilder, and
scaler to guarantee inference parity.
reasoning: Augmented numeric descriptors with richer sequence-driven signals and pairing statistics to capture
guide/target composition patterns linked to knockdown efficacy. FeatureBuilder-produced aggregates
summarize positional energy tracks and cross-strand interactions, while global standardization
prevents scale disparities from biasing downstream learners. Packaging the full preprocessing
pipeline ensures reproducibility for training and inference.

[MODEL ARCHITECTURE]
architecture: Primary: LightGBMRegressor (GBDT); Secondary: CatBoostRegressor; Tertiary: ElasticNet; Ensemble:
weighted average (0.54/0.33/0.13).
hyperparameters: LightGBM—learning_rate 0.0095, num_leaves 28, min_data_in_leaf 140, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf 25.0,
feature_fraction 0.56, bagging_fraction 0.55, bagging_freq 6, lambda_l1 3.0, lambda_l2 3.5,
extra_trees True, n_estimators 18,000, device_type "gpu"; CatBoost—depth 6, iterations 8,500,
learning_rate 0.027, l2_leaf_reg 5.0, random_strength 0.8, bagging_temperature 0.45, border_count
254, loss_function "RMSE", eval_metric "RMSE", bootstrap_type "Poisson", task_type "GPU";
ElasticNet—alpha 9e-4, l1_ratio 0.35, max_iter 6,000, tol 1e-4, fit_intercept True.
reasoning: Bias observed in run9 LightGBM implies need for milder regularization and broader leaf depth;
increased num_leaves and slightly lower L1/L2 penalties target improved expressiveness while keeping
conservative hessian and bagging constraints. Learning rate 0.0095 balances longer training horizon
(18k estimators) with stability. CatBoost settings emphasize GPU-enabled Poisson bagging, moderate
depth, and extended iterations for smoother convergence; tuned regularization mirrors search space
guidance. ElasticNet provides a linear baseline resilient to overfitting on standardized features.
Weighted ensemble favors LightGBM while leveraging CatBoost diversity and ElasticNet robustness,
with search spaces defined for CV/Bayesian tuning around these anchors.
